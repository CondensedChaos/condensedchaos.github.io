# Starbound Rail Train System - Marey Graph generator Web App
Made as a complement of: [Starbound Rail Train Mod](https://github.com/CondensedChaos/Starbound-Rail-Train)

But can be used as a Marey chart generator, just note that all times are expressed in seconds.
Anyone can make a derivative work of this web-app and turn it into a life-size Marey chart creator eventually [(License)](https://github.com/CondensedChaos/condensedchaos.github.io/tree/main#license) .

## What is a Marey chart?
A Marey chart is a [time-space diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time%E2%80%93distance_diagram), a kind of [cartesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) [diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram) used to analyze the flow of transportation system.

French scientist E. J. Marey reproduced a marvelous graphic train schedule whose design he attributed to Charles Ibry <sup><sub>([Cit. ResearcheGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286085953_Visual_Revelations_Stigler%27s_Law_of_Eponymy_and_Marey%27s_Train_Schedule_Did_Serjev_Do_It_Before_Ibry_and_What_About_Jules_Petiet#pf1))</sup></sub>

Time is plotted on the x asis, usually drawn at the top and stations are plotted on the y-axis, proportionally spaced by the physical distance between each station.

Each line on the chart represents a single train, with each point indicating its position on the tracks at a single point in time.

The steeper a line, the faster that train is traveling.


Invented in the 1840s and still used today to plan transportations network capacity and timetables.


I reccomend watching this awesome [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFLb1IPlY_k) about Marey graphs made by YouTube Channel [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A), narrated by Professor [Hannah Fry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Fry)
watching this same video sparked the inspiration in me to build this mod and webapp.


If you wanna know more watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWVRqhypxEU) afterwards  made by dr. [Kostas Tzanakakis](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Konstantinos-Tzanakakis), a more in depht, but stil beginner level, introduction to Marey graphs and trains timetables construction.
