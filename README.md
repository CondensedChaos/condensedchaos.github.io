### Starbound Rail Train System - Marey Graph generator Web App

##-= How to use: coming soon! =-

---
Made as a complement of: <a href="https://github.com/CondensedChaos/Starbound-Rail-Train">Starbound Rail Train Mod</a>
But can be used as a Marey chart generator, just note that all times are expressed in seconds.
Anyone can make a derivative work of this and turn it into a life-size Marey chart creator eventually.

More about Marey Charts:
