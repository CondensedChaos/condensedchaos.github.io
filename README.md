#What is a Marey chart?

A Marey chart is a [time-space diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time%E2%80%93distance_diagram), a kind of [cartesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) [diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram) used to analyze the flow of transportation system.
Time is plotted on the x asis, usually drawn at the top and stations are plotted on the y-axis, proportionally spaced by the physical distance between each station.
Each line on the chart represents a single train, with each point indicating its position on the tracks at a single point in time.
The steeper a line, the faster that train is traveling.


Invented in 1847 and still used today to plan transportations network capacity and timetables.


I reccomend watching this awesome [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFLb1IPlY_k) about Marey graphs made by YouTube Channel [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A), narrated by Professor [Hannah Fry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Fry) watching this same video sparked the inspiration in me to build this mod and webapp.


If you wanna know more watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWVRqhypxEU) afterwards  made by dr. Kostas Tzanakakis, a more in depht, but stil beginner level, introduction to Marey graphs and trains timetables construction.

Made as a complement of: <a href="https://github.com/CondensedChaos/Starbound-Rail-Train">Starbound Rail Train Mod</a>
But can be used as a Marey chart generator, just note that all times are expressed in seconds.
Anyone can make a derivative work of this and turn it into a life-size Marey chart creator eventually.
