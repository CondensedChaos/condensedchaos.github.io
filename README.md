### Starbound Rail Train System - Marey Graph generator Web App

##-= How to use: coming soon! =-

---
A Marey chart is a time-space diagram used to analyze the flow of transportation system.
Stations are plotted on the y-axis, proportionally spaced by the physical distance between each station, where the x-axis is time.
Each line on the chart represents a single train, with each point indicating its position on the tracks at a single point in time.
The steeper a line, the faster that train is traveling.

Invented in 1847 and still used today to plan transportations network capacity and timetables.

Made as a complement of: <a href="https://github.com/CondensedChaos/Starbound-Rail-Train">Starbound Rail Train Mod</a>
But can be used as a Marey chart generator, just note that all times are expressed in seconds.
Anyone can make a derivative work of this and turn it into a life-size Marey chart creator eventually.
